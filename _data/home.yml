about: The project aims to develop a sustainability-aware architecting framework specifically for cloud-based software services which incorporates all dimensions of system sustainability. In order to achieve this goal, we will also create solid architecting tools, methods, and guidelines for delivering sustainability-aware cloud-based software services. By these means, SustainableCloud will actively contribute to developing a sustainability-aware future cloud.
